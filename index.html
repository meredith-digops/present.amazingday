            <h2>Why AWS?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Security and Compliance</li>
              <li>Elastic Compute</li>
              <li>Organizational Efficiency</li>
            </ul>

          <section>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>Many people ask "Will my data be secure in the cloud?".  AWS provides many solutions to address these concerns such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS Identity and Access Management</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management Service</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/">AWS Certificate Manager</a></li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Enterprise Access</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html">Single Sign-On for IAM</a> has been very valuable</a></li>
                <li>IT account management can control user access to AWS accounts via AD</li>
                <li>Existing account lifecycles handle terminating access</li>
                <li>Users can access all of their roles from a "single pane of glass"</li>
              </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Compliance</h2>
            <p>A less obvious question is "How can the cloud help me reduce compliance scope?".  Data security is important but compliance requirements can drive up the cost of storing/transmitting that information on-premise.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>PCI at Meredith</h2>
            <p>The consumer revenue group launched new product in 2014 to handle e-commerce internally.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>E-commerce site and order pages hosted on-premise</li>
              <li>Order submission and payment handling hosted in AWS</li>
              <li>No PCI data is stored on-premise</li>
              <li>Avoided massive physical and logical security updates for on-premise systems</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Elastic Compute</h2>
            <p>Web traffic and related compute workloads vary by:<p>
            <ul>
              <li>Season (particularly during the holidays)</li>
              <li>Day of the week</li>
              <li>Hour of the day</li>
              <li>Promotional activity</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Auto Scaling Web Applications</h2>
            <p>This auto scaling workload uses roughly 60% of peak compute in the last 30 days or 30% of peak compute during holiday traffic.
            <img data-src="./opus-scaling.png"/>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Spot Instance Workloads</h2>
            <p>This auto scaling workload uses spot instances to further drive down costs.  The cost is roughly 15% of peak capacity as on-demand compute.
            <img data-src="./wpt-scaling.png"/>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Business Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Meredith is looking at elastic compute for enabling cost efficient analysis of our data lake.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>S3 provides a durable and cost efficient lake</li>
              <li>AWS EMR and Redshift automate complex infrastructure</li>
              <li>Healthy ecosystem of 3rd party offering for automation as well</li>
            </ul>
